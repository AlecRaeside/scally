# Scally Utilities

**Utilities** are low-level. They have a very narrow scope and may end up being used frequently, due to their separation from the semantics of the document and the theming of a component.

Each **Utility** class modifies a single trait (a small collection of similar styles).

To apply a trait, or a combination of traits to an element, add the corresponding class directly to the HTML.

Together, they can form a wide variety of UI patterns from simple principles.

**N.B.** nearly all **Utilities** come with the ability to apply at the main breakpoints. And all **Utilities** exist as a class and a Sass silent placeholder selector.
