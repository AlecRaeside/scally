/**
 * Web pages on iOS by default have a "momentum" style scrolling where a flick
 * of the finger sends the web page scrolling and it keeps going until
 * eventually slowing down and stopping as if friction is slowing it down. You
 * might think that any element with scrolling would have this behavior as
 * well, but it doesn't. You can add it back by applying this utility.
