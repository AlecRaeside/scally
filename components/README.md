## What are they?

Components are the discrete parts of a UI, and they make up the bulk of it. They're things like *pagination*, *breadcrumbs*, *hero-banner*, etc.

[Layout](layout/README.md) and [utilities](Utilities/README.md) should be your first port of call when constructing a UI as they do one job and they do it very well, which is to construct UI. That's the power of Scally and [why it exists](https://github.com/westfieldlabs/scally#what-is-scally).

So a component is what you create when a layout module or a utility can only get you so far. Well more utilities as **ALL** UI layout should be constructed with a layout module which is mainly the grid.

## How to use?

*Coming soon*.
