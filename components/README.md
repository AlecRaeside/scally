## What are they?

Components are what makes up the bulk of a UI. [Layout](layout/README.md) and [Utilities](Utilities/README.md) should be your first port of call when constructing a UI as they're very low-level and have a narrow scope. Basically they do one job and they do it very well. Layout and Utilities are the main features of Scally and what makes Scally the powerful framework it is, [see](https://github.com/westfieldlabs/scally#what-is-scally).
