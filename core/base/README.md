# Core

## Base

Base styles set the core styles for the main HTML elements of a project e.g.

- Links: `a`
- Headings: `h1` - `h6`
- Lists: `ul`, `ol`, `dl`
- Paragraphs: `p`

*And more.*

They sit right at the bottom in terms of the CSS Cascade (specificity) so they can easily be
overriden, with most using just element selectors.
