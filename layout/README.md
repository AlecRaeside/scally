# Layout

CSS, by its very nature, is used to lay elements out on the page. However, there is a distinction
between layouts dictating the major and minor components of a page. The minor components—such as
pagination, or forms, or navigation items—sit within the scope of major components such as a header,
or footer, or in most cases the main content of the page. The minor components are referred to as
**Components**. The major components are referred to as **Layout** styles.

Layout styles should be prefixed with `l-`.
