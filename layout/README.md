# Scally Layout

**Layout** exists to prevent you from writing CSS that handles the most common layout patterns in
user interface design, right down to the component level. Good comparisons for **Layout** are
permanent scaffolding and Lego.

The main part of **Layout** is a powerful fluid and nestable mobile first grid system allowing you
to set custom column widths at different viewports, making responsive layouts a sinch. The other
part of **Layout** is a generic container that ensures all of your UI uses consistent widths.

N.B. **Layout** styles should be prefixed with `l-` so that they're easily identifiable.
