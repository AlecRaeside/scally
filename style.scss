/**
 * Scally, being an OO framework, works in keeping with the open/closed
 * principle. Any custom styles *SHOULD NOT* be added or modified in Scally
 * directly, but added in your project master stylesheet (this stylesheet).
 * This also allows the framework to be updated seamlessly.
 *
 * CONTENTS
 *
 * Your settings............your project-specific settings.
 * Scally framework.........the entire Scally framework.
 * Your overrides...........override any Scally framework settings.
 * Your styles..............all your project-specific styles.
 *
 * N.B. the above order and the order within the Scally framework section must
 * always be followed.

/**
 * By default everything is imported. But if you want to be selective and you
 * definitely should, so your CSS is as lean as possible, then import via each
 * of Scally's sections e.g. Layout, or at the individual partial level within
 * each section e.g. Layout -> Grid. The Core section is however mandatory.
 *
 * N.B. the order specified below must always be followed or Scally will
 * break and if you're not using Bower or you customise where Bower installs
 * then you'll need to update the `@import` paths accordingly.
 *
 * CONTENTS
 *
 * Core.
 * Layout.
 * Components.
 * Utilities.

/* Your overrides
   ========================================================================= */

/**
 * Any settings you find set in Scally that you do not wish to keep, simply
 * redefine in your overrides file. This means that if Scally, for example,
 * sets your `$font-size` at `16px` and you wish it to be `14px`, simply
 * redeclare it in your overrides file. Scally ignores its own settings in
 * favour of using your own, so you can completely modify how Scally works
 * without ever having to alter the framework itself.
