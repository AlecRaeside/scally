/**

 * principle. Any custom styles *SHOULD NOT* be added or modified in Scally
 * directly, but added in your project master stylesheet (this stylesheet).
 * This also allows the framework to be updated seamlessly via Bower.

/**
 * By default everything is imported. But if you want to be selective and you
 * definitely should, so your CSS is as lean as possible, then import via each
 * of Scally's sections e.g. Layout or at the individual partial level. If you
 * only want specific partials then grab the relevant `@import` from the
 * relevant file and update the path. If you're being selective then make sure
 * to import in the correct order which is specified below.

/* Your Overrides
   ========================================================================= */

/**
 * Any settings (Sass variables: Core -> Settings) you find set in Scally
 * that you do not wish to keep, simply redefine in your overrides file. This
 * means that if Scally, for example, sets your `$font-size` at `16px` and you
 * wish it to be `14px`, simply redeclare it in your overrides file. Scally
 * ignores its own settings in favour of using your own, so you can completely
 * modify how Scally works without ever having to alter the framework itself.
 *
 * N.B. make sure to declare your overrides here and do not use the `!default`
 * keyword.
