/**
 * Scally, being an OO framework, works in keeping with the open/closed
 * principle. Any custom styles *SHOULD NOT* be added or modified in Scally
 * directly, but added in your project master stylesheet (this stylesheet).
 * This also allows the framework to be updated seamlessly via Bower.

   ========================================================================= */

/**
 * By default everything is imported. But if you want to be selective and you
 * definitely should, so your CSS is as lean as possible, then import via each
 * of Scally's sections e.g. Layout or at the individual partial level. If you
 * only want specific partials then grab the relevant `@import` from the
 * relevant file and update the path.
 *
 * N.B. the order specified below must always be maintained or Scally will
 * break.
 *
 * N.B. if you're not using Bower or you customise where Bower installs then
 * you'll need to update the `@import` paths accordingly.

/* Your Overrides
   ========================================================================= */

/**
 * Any settings you find set in Scally that you do not wish to keep, simply
 * redefine in your overrides file. This means that if Scally, for example,
 * sets your `$font-size` at `16px` and you wish it to be `14px`, simply
 * redeclare it in your overrides file. Scally ignores its own settings in
 * favour of using your own, so you can completely modify how Scally works
 * without ever having to alter the framework itself.
